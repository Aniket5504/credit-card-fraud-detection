Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest in R

ðŸ“Œ Project Description:
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset using Machine Learning techniques. The dataset is often highly imbalanced, with very few fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones. To improve the modelâ€™s performance, data balancing techniques are applied before training a classification model. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of transaction patterns.


ðŸš€ Technologies & Tools Used:
Programming Language: R

Libraries & Packages:

randomForest - For training a Random Forest classifier

caret - For model evaluation and train-test splitting

ROSE - For handling class imbalance (oversampling & undersampling)

ggplot2 - For data visualization


Machine Learning Concepts:

Supervised Learning (Classification)

Data Balancing (ROSE for synthetic sampling)

Feature Engineering & Selection

Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
